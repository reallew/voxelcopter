# voxelcopter
Multithreaded helicopter simulator with CPU-only rendering (raycasting) using terrain from the 1992's game Comache.

This project was heavily inspired by https://github.com/s-macke/VoxelSpace. Read that page if you want to learn something about the ingenious simple rendering algorithm.
